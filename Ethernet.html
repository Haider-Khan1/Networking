<h2>UTP and STP</h2>
<p>for ethernet we will be talking about twisted and untwisted pairs. When connected this allows you for the cable
    to connect to the computer's network card and the network port of your router, switch, modem.
</p>

<h2>UTP</h2>
<p>untwisted Pair cables consists of  pair color-coded wires twisted around each other.
    The wires are to twisted to prevent electromagnetic interference (crosstalk) which is a electromagnetic 
    disturbance. This is mostly used in homes and businesses.
</p>

<h2>STP</h2>
<p>Shielded Twisted Pair is very similar to UTP with the only difference being a foil shield that is wrapped
    around the color-coded wires. This adds an extra layer of protection against electromagnetic disturbance
    leaking into and out of the cable. Mostly used for industrial purposes.
</p>

<h2>Most common twisted pairs</h2>
<p>There are two cables most commonly used in LAN. Striaght (patch) cable and crossover cable.
    These have two differnet wiring standards which are 568A and 568B these have different color patterns.
</p>
<p>568A: 1. White - Green 2. Green 3. White - Orange 4. Blue 5. White - Blue 6. Orange 7. White - Brown 8. Brown</p>
<p>568B: 1. White - Orange 2. Orange 3. White - Green 4. Blue 5. White - Blue 6. Green 7. White - Brown 8. Brown</p>

<p>Although they have differnet color patterns it doesn't matter which one you use both do the same thing.
    If both cables ends are the same standard this would be a Striaght (patch) cable.
    It is the most commonly used ethernet cable on LAN and used to connect dissimilar devices toghether.
    Only different between these two is one is wired according to the A and B standard.
    Crossover cables are similar to patch cables except they used both standards to connect to something.
    And the other difference is they connect 2 similar devices together.
</p>

<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>Ethernet Categories goes from 3 to 7 and this is the difference between speeds for these categories.
    The numbers represent the tightness of the twists that are applied to the wires.
    As these categories go up the speed does too. Going from 10 megabits per second to 10 gigbits.
    Most networks use CAT 5e since the speed is 1Gbps. Those who can afford to use the best catergory,
    category 8 which is the ultimate copper cable, has a distance up to 30 meters, but speeds of 40Gbps
