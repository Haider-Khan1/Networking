<h2>RJ45</h2>
<p>Most common, used to connect computers and network devices in a local area network. Like connecting a computer to a switch</p>

<h2>UTP</h2>
<p>Used to join two cbles together using their RJ45 connectors.</p>

<h2>RJ48</h2>
<p>similar to RJ45, but used with sheilded twisted pair cables and uses T1 lines.</p>

<h2>RJ11</h2>
<p>Used to connect telephone equitment, used to connect computers to a LAN using the modem</p>

<h2>BNC</h2>
<p>typpe of RF connecter used on coaxial cabale. Used for analog and digital video transmissions as well as audio. </p>

<h2>F-Type</h2>
<p>Used by cable providers to attach to cable modems.</p>

<h2>USB</h2>
<p>USB wireless adapters which gives computers wi-fi access</p>

<h2>Fiber Optic</h2>
<p>SC connector: uses a push-pull connector and used between floors in a building.
    MTRJ: Uses Latches pull-pull connection and used to replace the SC.
    LC: Local connector and designed to compete with SC connector.
    ST: Staight Tip which uses a half twist bayonet type of lock, very large.
</p>

<h2>Fiber coupler</h2>
<p>Used to connect two of the same fiber cables. Not to be mistaken with giber adapters which connect two different fiber cables.
</p>

<h2>UPC vs APC</h2>
<p>UPC connecter would have frequent signal loss due to the imprefections on the ST cables. Due to this when light
    passes throught some light would reflect and come back to the sending cable. APC solves this due to how the tip of the angle is created.
    This means it doesn't reflect back into the sender light and rather to the ST wall.
