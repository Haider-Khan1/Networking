<h2>WiFi router</h2>
<p>Allows for multiple wireless and wired devices to connect to it. Usually used in small offices and homes.
    Has a built in firewall and ethernet port.
</p>

<h2>WAP</h2>
<p>Used for medium sized or large sized organizations. Connects to the router and allows multiple devices to connect to it.
    Once connected to the router they will all broadcast the WiFi signal. Also, allows for organization as you can 
    edit the router and it will be applied to all WAPs (WiFi Access Points) connected to that router using ethernet.
</p>

<h2>Differences</h2>
<p>WiFi routers are built similar to a switch allowing wired devices to connect to it, whereas WAP's do not have this.
    WAP's only allow wireless devices to connect to them. Routers also have a built in firewall while WAP's do not.
</p>

<h2>DHCP</h2>
<p>DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a service that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
    Routers have a built in DHCP, but WAP's do not have a built in DHCP meaning they must get their IP from the router.</p>

<h2>LAN port</h2>
<p>WAP's do not have a LAN (internet) port meaning they cannot connect to a modem and must use a router to connect
    to the modem.
