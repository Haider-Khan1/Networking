<h2>Hubs</h2>
<p>The purpose of a hub is to connect all your network devices together on an internal network.
    The biggest problem with a hub is that it only knows when a device is connected to one of its ports.
    The hub has no intelligence and now idea where data is meant to be sent to.
    If data were to go onto 1 port it would copy and send it to all ports, creating unessecary bandwith and lack of security.

<h2>Switches</h2>
<p>Switches are very similar to hubs, but they are intelligent. It has a switch table which consists of MAC addresses and ports.
    This allows for someone to send a data packet to a specific computer rather than 1 copy it to all.
    The switch uses the MAC addresses to help identify computers.

<h2>Router</h2>
<p>A router routes data from one network to another based on their IP address.
    A bit similar to how a firewall works, specific data packets are sent to specific networks and the others are re-routed.
