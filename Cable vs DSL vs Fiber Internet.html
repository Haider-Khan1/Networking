<h2>Cable internet</h2>
<p>Cable internet is a high speed technology used to connect to your modem/router (gateway) which is used to connect
    to you ISP. Due to this being provided to you by your ISP other users in your neighborhood have to share
an internet bandwith. Meaning peak times when surfing the web can be very slow. </p>

<h2>DSL internet</h2>
<p>DSL or Digital Subscriber Line allows for homes and businesses to access broadband data over the net.
    Comes with a DSL modem which allows people to use the net and phone lines.
    Not associated with Dial-up connection which is very slow and unorganized compared to DSL.
    However, DSL may not be as fast as cable you don't have to share bandwith since everyone has their
    own connection.</p>

    <p>DSL has different download and upload speeds as well. ADSL (asymmetirc) makes downloading considerably
    faster then upload while SDSL (symmetric) makes both even with the same speed.
    Lastly, VDSL (very high bit rate) makes both extremely fast.</p>

    <h2>Fiber internet</h2>
    <p>Fiber is one of the fastest internet speeds out there, it uses light to send data and has 
        download and upload speeds of up to 1000 mbps. It also serves as the backbone of the net.
        Fiber internet can travel long distances compared to cable and DSL, however it is 
        relativly new and more expensive.
